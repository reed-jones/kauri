# Kauri

Kauri is built up to be a javascript based [laravel](https://laravel.com/)-esque framework for developing web applications. Kauri aims to be an easy to use, pre-configured full stack framework. Bringing together [Koa](https://koajs.com/) & [Koa-Router](https://github.com/ZijianHe/koa-router) for the main server, [Knex.js](https://knexjs.org/) & [Objection.js](https://vincit.github.io/objection.js/) for the database connections, your choice between [Pug](https://pugjs.org) or [EJS](https://ejs.co/) (or both) as the templating engine.
